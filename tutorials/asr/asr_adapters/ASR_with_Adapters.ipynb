        "\n",

Therefore, after the addition of the adapters, the original model does not lose any accuracy at all (even without training the adapters).\n",
        "- **Fast convergence**: Since the adapters only need to learn to modify the module's output slightly, and each adapter has a trivial parameter cost, they converge rapidly.\n",
        "- **Adapt only the encoder**: Adapters can be used anywhere, but they are most commonly used in just the encoder, keeping the decoder modules frozen. This allows the decoder to be unaffected by costly CTC/RNN-T training, which takes time to converge, and just the adapter modules in the encoder need to be updated.\n",
        "- **Dynamic and flexible adaptation**: Since adapter modules can be added any number of times, a single shared \"core\" model can have multiple adapters that are enabled/disabled dynamically to adapt to numerous scenarios. This potentially offers the case where a single \"core\" model is shared across multiple users, and each user has a small, personal adapter module used for personalization.  "

        "- **Frozen tokenization/decoding**: A consequence of the frozen decoder is that we cannot change the vocabulary (or tokenizer) of the decoder layer - as this would cause the model to forget its past training entirely. This also means that **adapters cannot be used to train in a different language than the original language**. The text of the new domain must be supported by the original model's tokenizer/decoder.\n",
        "  - **Note**: There is nothing fundamentally wrong with still changing the vocabulary of a model that supports adapters. The benefits of adapters will reduce significantly and require costly training (similar in time and memory to finetuning). The model can no longer recover its performance by disabling all of its adapters.\n",
